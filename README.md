## Install Dependencies
It is different from `npm`, Here, we use `bower` package manager to install all Dependencies. so just like it.

```
$ bower install
```

## Install the Polymer-CLI

First, make sure you have the [Polymer CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/polymer-cli) installed. Then run `polymer serve` to serve your application locally.

## Viewing Your Application

```
$ polymer serve
```

## Building Your Application

```
$ polymer build
```

This will create builds of your application in the `build/` directory, optimized to be served in production. You can then serve the built versions by giving `polymer serve` a folder to serve from:

```
$ polymer serve build/default
```

## Running Tests

```
$ polymer test
```

Your application is already set up to be tested via [web-component-tester](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester). Run `polymer test` to run your application's test suite locally.

## finally

This project just a demo for me, if you want to learn `polymer`, you can use `git clone` to download. and i have to say that was coooooooool.<br>

guys, have fun.
